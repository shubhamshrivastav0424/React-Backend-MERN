    "blogContent": "In a world where data fluctuates between showing the impact of accreditation on healthcare institutions and negating it, we, at the Health Care Accreditation Council (HCAC), were intrigued to look into whether accredited healthcare institutions in Jordan were more ready to deal with the requirements of COVID-19 or not? HCAC is Jordan and the region’s leading quality and patient safety organization, providing services through consultation, capacity building and accreditation. During establishment, we faced scepticism on whether the accreditation approach was right for Jordan. Previously this country boasted a noteworthy medical and health sector, while compliance to regulations and patient safety standards emerged as a weakness. But now, I am proud to showcase that the accreditation approach has been able to push the bar quite high and induce continuous improvements in healthcare organizations. In early 2019, HCAC looked at baseline and post accreditation data for several public, private and military hospitals vis-a-vis the HCAC hospital accreditation standards. The improvement was huge, from less than 30% compliance with standards in the baseline to more than 95% post accreditation.",

    "blogContent": "In the current context of the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, it seemed interesting to me, not to comment on current events, but to offer some landmarks and references on the concept of resilience. According to Boris Cyrulnik, French doctor, neurologist and psychiatrist, resilience is the art of sailing torrents; it is also the ability to live, to succeed, to develop despite adversity. The work carried out by the WHO Department of Integrated Health Services (which has taken over the missions of the Service Delivery and Safety Department whose objective is help countries to “rethink health care”) is very instructive in this regard. We can cite the National Quality Policy and Strategy programme, which addresses resilience, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, as “the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions”.",

During the last few weeks, people and communities have shown solidarity worldwide like never before, and the human, social and moral values seem to have gotten back on the right track as everybody realised that we are in this fight together.If there is something else that has proven impactful during the pandemic, it is the power of information and innovation - in all its forms. Thoughtfully leveraging technology has now become the ultimate conduit for reliable information that can help us win the battle against this invisible enemy. While efforts around the world have been contributing to understanding the biology of the 2019-novel Coronavirus and developing response strategies, the pandemic has impacted each country and region differently, with the confounding variable always the same, always there, everywhere: the vulnerable groups.",

    "blogContent": "In the past few weeks healthcare professionals have been fully focussed caring for enormous numbers of people infected with COVID-19. They did an amazing job. Not in the least because healthcare professionals and leaders have been using continues improvement as part of their accreditation program for many years.It has become part of their DNA. This has enabled them to change many processes as needed during COVID-19, using a cross-functional problem solving approach in (very) rapid improvement cycles. And there is an urgency in making progress using the momentum of adaptive change. Until a vaccine has been created for COVID-19, healthcare has to adapt to the new reality. Organisations will have to scale up and down again while maintaining high standards in quality and safety of care. Elective care has to commence while COVID-19 might flair up again. New realities like social distancing and increased use of e-health have to be faced. While implementing lasting changes is a totally different challenge than realizing quick and unpredictable responses in crisis situations, the underlying key to success in both, during and post COVID-19, is the same: invest in people, in professionals. The required solutions to make our healthcare adaptive are not found in the hardware or software nor in systems, but in the people. Together, professionals make the difference.",

Over the course of three years, and supported by over $500,000 (USD) in funding from Cure Rare Disease, SickKids will build upon existing research and aims to develop a CRISPR/Cas9-based treatment to correct gene duplications that cause DMD by restoring full-length dystrophin, a protein critical to muscle strength and function.  DMD is a rare, fatal muscle-wasting disease caused by the body’s inability to produce dystrophin. “We are excited to have SickKids, Canada’s premier pediatric hospital, join our collaborative research efforts to develop CRISPR-based therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy,” said Rich Horgan, founder and president of Cure Rare Disease.  “This collaboration is a major milestone in our work to hopefully expand our drug development pipeline and continue building our pioneering model to create and dose customized therapeutics for rare diseases like DMD.”",

I was in a time where I was transitioning from my studies to work, and this seemed like a good time to try homeschooling for at least for a year. That is how it started for us. Our twin daughters are now 16 years old and still studying at home. Our son, Damian, 12 years old, has been homeschooled since after preschool. Damian’s journey is very different from his sisters. Damian was diagnosed with Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy at 8 y.o and is neuro-divergent, with ADHD. At a young age he struggled with self-regulation in group classes. Damian really benefited from homeschooling, because we could customize and adjust his schooling as he needed.  For our daughters, homeschool is a choice, whereas for Damian it felt almost necessary because there were no other viable options locally.",

In my opinion, people will always remember stories and experiences over medical statistics and terms – whether that is a relation point that resonated with them, their struggle with receiving care, or anything else.

The blue zones are comprised of five regions:During his research, Buettner discovered that not only was longevity common in these areas, but there was also an absence of many of the chronic illnesses, such as obesity, and heart disease, that plague many other cultures in the world. The people also spent less time in sedentary behaviors and seemed to experience less stress. Remarkably, these populations don’t rely on public health messages to “eat less, move more;” rather, their health and longevity is directly related to their lifestyles. Inhabitants of the blue zones live in environments that make it possible for them to live their best lives by moving naturally, connecting to their “right tribe” and eating foods that are largely unprocessed, seasonal and fresh. Buettner identified nine traits that contribute to blue zone longevity, which he has termed the Power 9.",

Once you’ve done this a few times and have listened to the recordings, you have essentially taught your brain to chase the reward of feeling better after exercise or any physical activity. You have created a behavioral loop in which you have taught your brain how to enhance mood and derive a powerful and positive effect from a single exercise effort.A single action that leaves you feeling better emotionally or mentally expands possibilities and generates hope. It also helps you reframe exercise and change it from a motivational challenge to a mood-transforming opportunity.It’s worth noting that this strategy can be employed and work equally well when going for a walk or any other form of physical activity. Incidental physical activity may not be as intense as exercise and, in general, does not feel as daunting or challenging as exercise to many people.",

At the end of the 16-week training protocols, each group had improved their fitness levels, which was measured by time to reach VT2 and the time to reach exhaustion. The HIIT-T group demonstrated better results than the HIIT-WB or MICT groups, supporting the idea that HIIT is a time-efficient workout solution. This is great news for those days when time can be a factor and a gym workout just isn’t feasible. In other words, when time gets tight, a four-minute Tabata workout may be sufficient for maintaining your current level of fitness.When time is tight, it can be difficult to do your usual 30- to 60-minute workout.

The compromise: If grandparents couldn’t travel to us on the holiday, we still made a date to all get together on another day to celebrate. Over the years, I ditched a few more customs, too, along with the guilt that tended to come with not following what was expected of me. I did, however, keep a few traditions that I love, and now I’m able to use the holidays as a time to reconnect with my loved ones and recharge myself.
